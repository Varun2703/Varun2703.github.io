I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, and a member of the [Wolfpack Privacy and Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) where I am advised by [Dr. Alessandra Scafuro](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/ascafuro/).
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2017.

I am interested in cryptography. More specifically, I am interested in anonymity and privacy-preserving multiparty protocols and their applications to real-world systems like blockchains. Find my latest resume [here](/files/resume.pdf)
